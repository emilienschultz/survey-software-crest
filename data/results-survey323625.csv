They are very convenient and easy to use I think keeping them updated and improving them would be useful (adding a local storage option to replace CASD as mentioned would be nice). Now, I have the impression that not all of them are fully updated with all softwares, a few colleagues have been directed toward the cluster number 6 because Python is not updated on the other clusters.

Un point important à comprendre pour le labo de stats notamment : je pense que personne n'a besoin de grosse puissance de calcul *en permanence* ; en revanche, nous sommes nombreux à avoir des besoins ponctuels, mais, dans ce cas, pouvoir accès aussitôt à une grosse puissance de calcul (notamment pouvoir lancer une tâche des centaines de fois sur un serveur avec pleins de processeurs) peut vraiment augmenter nos chances de publier nos articles dans des meilleures revues. C'est particulièrement le cas de ceux d'entre nous qui publient dans les conférences de ML (machine learning) et qui doivent faire des grosses xp numériques avant une date limite. 
Les serveurs labostat et labostat2 sont déjà pas mal, mais ils sont encore assez petits par rapport à ces besoins ponctuels. ","816.9","34.21","","","","","","","","104.56","","","","","","","","","","","","304.81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","373.32","","","","","","",""

But I just can't use the Matlab installed on the servers: it's way, way, way too slow to run! I had to install Matlab locally instead. This is not without costs: I have to switch regularly from my server session (where I do most of my non-Matlab activities) to my local session (where I run Matlab), and each time I switch I have to close all windows. This is also a big problem for some ENSAE/MiE courses that use Matlab (and Dynare): Matlab takes sometimes more than 15 minutes to open, several minutes to run big files, etc. For me, this is by far the Number One problem to solve: install Matlab in such a way that it runs reasonably quickly.

I will need to do parallel computations and to store bigger and bigger datasets.
I think that I'll have more and more necessity to use Matlab since it is much more powerful than poen source softwares like R.

It would be great to have more assistance on how to parallelize and how to optimize computations through the use of server.  ","I don't have other elements, but I just want to stress the importance of having Dropbox and Matlab made available from GENES. 
Since when GENES is paying for Dropbox (the collective licence) and Matlab, it is extremely better and this helps a lot my research. This makes possible exchanges with coauthors that could not be possible without Dropbox. So they are really essential!

A similar remark also applies to WinEdt: I've tried to switch to the open source Overleaf and it is really not comparable to WinEdt. It simply does not work for many packages and for complicated documents with a structure.

Finally, it is also great to have the possibility to use Zoom for meetings without time restrictions. It gives the possibility to work with coauthors at distance and it is better than Teams (also because in Teams I do not have the possibility to organise meetings).

Thank you very much for this survey and for offering these softwares!    ","1984.17","64.15","","","","","","","","382.07","","","","","","","","","","","","481.57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1056.38","","","","","","",""
