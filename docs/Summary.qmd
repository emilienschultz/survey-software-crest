df = pd.read_csv("../data/results-survey323625.csv")
# t = pd.DataFrame(pd.Series(list(df.columns)))
# t["reco"] = None
# t.to_csv("reco_columns.csv", index=False)
reco_col = pd.read_csv("../notebooks/reco_columns.csv")
reco_col = dict(reco_col.set_index("0").dropna()["reco"])
print(df.shape)
df.columns = [(lambda i: reco_col[i] if i in reco_col else i)(i) for i in df.columns]
df.head(2)

# filter
f = df["time"] > 60
df = df[f]
